      "I recently upgraded to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G in Pastel Lime, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Here's what I love about it:**Pros:**1. **Affordable 5G:** The inclusion of 5G capabilities in a phone at this price point is a huge plus. Streaming and downloading content is lightning-fast, and I'm future-proofed for upcoming advancements in connectivity.2. **Sleek Design:** The Pastel Lime color is unique and adds a refreshing touch to the device. The slim profile and lightweight build make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.3. **Smooth Performance:** With 8GB of RAM, multitasking is a breeze. The phone handles various apps and tasks simultaneously without any lag or slowdowns.4. **Ample Storage:** The 128GB storage provides enough room for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, the option to expand storage via microSD card is a thoughtful addition.5. **Impressive Display:** The AMOLED display offers vibrant colors and deep blacks, enhancing my media consumption experience. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, whether I'm watching videos or browsing the web.**Cons:**1. **Average Camera Performance:** While the camera setup is decent, it doesn't quite match the quality of flagship devices. Photos in well-lit conditions turn out great, but low-light performance could be improved.2. **Plastic Back:** While the plastic back keeps the device lightweight, it may not feel as premium as glass-backed phones. A good quality case helps mitigate this, though.3. **Battery Life:** The battery life is good, but not exceptional. It easily lasts me through a day of moderate use, but I'd appreciate a bit more juice for heavy usage days.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers a compelling package of features at an affordable price. It's a great option for users who want to experience 5G connectivity without breaking the bank. The design, performance, and display quality are its standout features, making it an excellent value for money. While there are a few areas for improvement, the overall experience this phone provides is truly remarkable."

      "Mobile is perfect at this rangeOnly issues with batteryIt will not work all dayRest all is good",
      "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n     Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",
      "I bought it for my father and I see it that this is decent phone as per my father pov.But if you are perfomance lover and gamer i should not recommende it.About the battery life it gives me 2 days backup (Point to be noted I bought it for my father and I am writing review as his pov)About charging it comes with 33w super vooc charger and charge the phone 0to100 in 1h10mAnd 30to90 in 30m.Software experience is super because iam using miui compare with them then I saw oxygen OS is good.Almost stock Android experience.Best phone under 20k for non gamer and basic mobile user.",
      "Great photos n videos, long battery life with fast charging, Android updates available, a lots of hidden features , just a little heavy",
      "All is fine. Camera is not great. It's too grainy. I donno why it's just bad.",
      "Performance:Awesome Product Quality:Exceeded expectations Best Feature:Processor and Battery Bought this for my friend / neighbor because his fone got damaged .I had him test it for a week..and so far, this mid-range phone has exceeded my expectations! It doesn't get hot when charging or gaming--plus battery life lasted 2 days .The phone itself connects fast wirelessly and doesn't lag at all even when multitasking! OnePlus really surprised me with its performance! I will buy again but this time I'll opt for the high end/flagship model for myself!",
      "Phone is ok but the battery life is poor. camera is good.",
      "I am writing this review after using this mobile for one year. Before I used redmi note for 5 years without any problem and with great battery backup. But one plus mobile is having very less power backup and also apps like Google pay gets stucked sometimes. Redmi mobiles  are much better at this price range w.r.t performance and power backup.",
      "-",
      "En rendimiento es muy bueno habré aplicación sin problema y de manera muy rápida y fluida... La cámara no es de lo mejor y el sonido tampoco... De ahí en fuera creo que es un muy buen teléfono la relación calidad precio es muy buena",
      "Ad says it will work with T-Mobile 5g... It does not it only is capable of 4g unless you are over in UK then it will get 5g.. Do not buy if you live in USA.OnePlus Technology Nord CE 2 5GIMEI:This device is not compatible with T-Mobile’s network technology. Tell me moreWe can’t confirm that this device is unblocked.

      "I haven't bought a phone in the last 4 years as I could not find any phone that I liked. But my trusty old Honor phone has been showing its age for a while, and I had to get a new phone.My aim was to get a decent mid-range phone with solid build quality, performance and a decent camera. I ruled out Samsung as I had several bad experiences with them and also ruled out the whole Oppo/Vivo line due to their flashy looks and the bloatware ridden OS.I primarily use my phone for browsing, phone calls, music, very light gaming and occasional photography. I own a gaming computer and a decent DSLR camera, so gaming and camera performance were not a top priority for me.The Nord 2T checked most of my requirements. It has a decent camera setup (don't expect iPhone or Xperia 1 level performance), pretty good performance, good screen and a strong battery. The price also seemed fair to me.What I liked:1. Good screen2. Decent camera3. Really fast charging and great battery backup4. No bloatware in the OS. It is very clean.5. Not too flashy6. Good call quality7. No camera notch or punch-hole in the middle. The camera punch hole is in a corner8. Physical silent mode toggleWhat I disliked:1.The volume rocker is on the left side which is annoying as I inadvertently press it while trying to press the Lock/Unlock button2. The auto-brightness algorithm is buggy and it tends to go too dark sometimes. Looks like a software issue.3. No option to remove the Google Feed screen - I hate it. But it could be removed by disabling the Google app.4. Volume level is a bit too low. But I always use the headphones, so not an issue for me.5. Very slippery. I have the 'Sandstone' version and the phone keeps sliding though your fingers. Absolutely no grip what-so-ever. So the first thing I did was to get a back-cover with rubbery finish.",
      "First of all this is my first OnePlus 😊. Let's talk about the pros first.1) Rear Camera is best with Sony Flagship sensor, OIS is working pretty good.2) Dual speaker top front firing and bottom  Speaker is loud and crisp. Good for entertainment.3) Ram is expandable (8+5).4) It has 80W fast charging, feels like very fast. Full charge within 10 to 15 min (mind-blowing).5) Side mounted slider button for activating sound profiles like silent,vibrate. (a must wanted feature)6) Design of the phone is excellent and looks very aesthetic, eye catching from the back.Finally here are cons:1) battery drains easily, it comes with 4500 mAh battery but doesn't feel like that but mildly last a day with normal use.For medium use with normal gaming requires charging about 2 to 3 times a day but doesn't feels bad due to fast charging. But even though battery life cycle reduces fast--So Gamers do go for 5000mAh + series--2) front camera is average as compared to rear one. It does the job, works good in day light and not good in dim lighting conditions.These are the cons i have to point out.My Overall experience is good with this phone cons can be compromised according to this price, specification and afterall this OnePlus badging. It's an experienceGo for it.",
      "This is a review after using the phone for about 10 days. My initial reaction was that the UI sucks - and it does suck compared to the Samsung UI. But OnePlus gives far less bloat ware than Samsung does. (I was upgrading from a Samsung M21). Samsung UI is more slick though.Battery life is very good. It lasts the whole day with heavy hotspot tethering usage. With light usage and no tethering, it easily lasts 2 days. The VOOC charger is great and charges the phone in less than 30 minutes. But even though it’s an 80w charger, it does not charge my MacBook Pro.This phone is pretty close to stock android, and is overall quite good. It has many of the smart features that come with stock android. Like live transcription, automatically copying OTPs from messages, etc.The fingerprint scanner and face unlock are both good.The phone does heat up a bit with heavy hotspot usage - but it’s manageable.The hotspot wifi tethering feature was crucial for me. It works well with this phone. It has a strong 5G radio and a strong wifi radio. No complaints there.The camera sucks. Really. Feels like the camera from 10k rupee phone. But I don’t really care, as this is my secondary phone.Overall, it’s a good phone for the price range.",
      "Good product with fast charging in 20 min, but its battery life is 12-15 hours in the internet is on continuously. Good camera, screen, sound and other features.",
      "It's a very good phone, camera quality is also good. Display is very smooth. I have been using this phone from last 1year but it's never get lag or hang. It has very useful features which can help you with day to day works.",
      "Good quality phoneSound or camra goodBattery backup also goodPrice good",
      "The \"Gray Shadow\" color variant looks sleek and modern.It handles everyday tasks and multitasking with ease.The display is sharp and vibrant, making it enjoyable for media consumption and gaming.The battery life is decent, but heavy users might need to charge during the day. Fast charging support helps alleviate this issue.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord 2T 5G is a solid mid-range phone with good performance, a nice display, and a reliable camera system.",
      "Have been using this mobile for last 2 months it worth for money considering 12 gb ram as I am IT engineer and I basically used lot manies software which needs high potential process and ram these all includes in one peace"

      "It’s really cool smartphone under 25k I got from Amazon. Camera quality is stunning. Battery is quite good it runs around 2 days on a single charge. Storage is good as per my requirements. Fast processor that allows multitasking. Overall, it’s a value for money deal for me.",
      "Bought this phone for my wife and she's been using it for 3-4 days now. She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range.",
      "Nice choice of you are casually gaming and multitasking. It has got Android 14 which makes it better and also OnePlus software is perfect. No lag faced till now. Will update further.Just one thing that selfie camera of perfect but the main back camera is not as expected. It's not bad like it cannot be preferred but the quality of camera can be improved if night mode doesn't focuses to brighten the face much",
      "I got it for 21k (8+128)GB variant!It's really value for money if you got it for even 22k.Don't get me wrong, I know there are new phones coming with good specs and I also know of that oppofication like it's running on Color OS type with clean experience... But yeah as It's a phone from the promising brand that's why I bought it.If you wanna do hardcore gaming the go for another options but for casual day to day life and task it's good, also it can handle little bit of gaming as per my experience!And yeah Don't go for the Sony IMX sensor! It doesn't perform as the OnePlus 12 bcs chipset also matters in camera processing!I hope you got it!Thanks...",
      "Have been using the phone for over a week now.Positives:1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others.",
      "For me it's good but still camera is not good and upto the mark as compare to others phone in this price but clicks decent good quality pictures but was expecting more than this under 25k mobile when we see the Sony hardware it's not that quality level so it's request to OnePlus developers that to give software updates regarding camera optimization and also battery optimization and about gaming it's very good in casual gaming but heats up when we use more than 10 to 15 minutes and last thing is about buying mobile through emi my friends don't ever buy phone thru emi with credit card bcos banks are charging hidden charges of GST cgst and all other stuff and around 500 rs my money was taken through all that useless charges bcos I buyed the mobile through ICICI credit card mobile. So avoid emi if possible."

      "I recently upgraded to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G in Pastel Lime, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Here's what I love about it:**Pros:**1. **Affordable 5G:** The inclusion of 5G capabilities in a phone at this price point is a huge plus. Streaming and downloading content is lightning-fast, and I'm future-proofed for upcoming advancements in connectivity.2. **Sleek Design:** The Pastel Lime color is unique and adds a refreshing touch to the device. The slim profile and lightweight build make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.3. **Smooth Performance:** With 8GB of RAM, multitasking is a breeze. The phone handles various apps and tasks simultaneously without any lag or slowdowns.4. **Ample Storage:** The 128GB storage provides enough room for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, the option to expand storage via microSD card is a thoughtful addition.5. **Impressive Display:** The AMOLED display offers vibrant colors and deep blacks, enhancing my media consumption experience. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, whether I'm watching videos or browsing the web.**Cons:**1. **Average Camera Performance:** While the camera setup is decent, it doesn't quite match the quality of flagship devices. Photos in well-lit conditions turn out great, but low-light performance could be improved.2. **Plastic Back:** While the plastic back keeps the device lightweight, it may not feel as premium as glass-backed phones. A good quality case helps mitigate this, though.3. **Battery Life:** The battery life is good, but not exceptional. It easily lasts me through a day of moderate use, but I'd appreciate a bit more juice for heavy usage days.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers a compelling package of features at an affordable price. It's a great option for users who want to experience 5G connectivity without breaking the bank. The design, performance, and display quality are its standout features, making it an excellent value for money. While there are a few areas for improvement, the overall experience this phone provides is truly remarkable."

I rated 5/55) Os experience is good till now, I recently update the phone and got may security patch with it. Didn't face any issue in my phone. Software is very clean and smooth. Did not get any ads. I liked it. OnePlus promised that they will give 3 years Os updates with 4 years security update which is big things. I rated 5/56) Streo speaker which is loud enough. 4/5If gaming is not your primary concern then just go for it.

      "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n     I have uploaded video of screen picture quality and Night photo which I took at 3 AM. Pretty impressed. Below is the detailed review.Pros:Powerful Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processorLong-lasting battery with 100W fast chargingBeautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED curved display with 120Hz refresh rateClean and simple softwareCompetitive priceGood for gamingCons:No expandable storageNo headphone jackCamera could be betterI have observed slow finger print response.Overall, the OnePlus 11R is a great phone for those who are looking for a powerful and affordable device. It has a great processor, a long-lasting battery, and a beautiful display. The software is also very clean and simple to use. However, the camera could be better, and there is no expandable storage or headphone jack.Here is a more detailed look at the pros and cons of the OnePlus 11R:Pros:1) Powerful Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor: The OnePlus 11R is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, which is one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market. This means that the phone is incredibly fast and can handle even the most demanding tasks with ease.2) I have played  games like Genshin Impact, PUBG, Call of Duty and Asphalt games runs really smooth.3) Long-lasting battery with 100 W fast charging: The OnePlus 11R has a large 5000mAh battery, which is more than enough to power the phone for a full day on a single charge. The phone also supports 100 W fast charging, which means that you can quickly top up the battery when you need to.4) I am fan of  curved screen it gives you premium look. I haven't seen any accidental touches from my side. The OnePlus 11R has a beautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.

I usually keep phone Wi-Fi on when I go to sleep within 3 to 4 hours it drains 10% to 15% of battery which is not good.2) While I have seen Lag sometimes but gaming gives you smooth experience.3) The OnePlus 11R has a triple-lens rear camera system, but the camera performance is not as good as some of the other phones in this price range. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide and macro cameras are not as good.Overall, the OnePlus 11R is a great phone for those who are looking for a powerful and affordable device. It has a great processor, a long-lasting battery, and a beautiful display. The software is also very clean and simple to use. However, the camera could be better.",

In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",
      "I bought it for my father and I see it that this is decent phone as per my father pov.But if you are perfomance lover and gamer i should not recommende it.About the battery life it gives me 2 days backup (Point to be noted I bought it for my father and I am writing review as his pov)About charging it comes with 33w super vooc charger and charge the phone 0to100 in 1h10mAnd 30to90 in 30m.Software experience is super because iam using miui compare with them then I saw oxygen OS is good.Almost stock Android experience.Best phone under 20k for non gamer and basic mobile user.",

Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Update 4: Received Android 14 software upgrade on Jan 12 2024. Device is now stable.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others.",
      "For me it's good but still camera is not good and upto the mark as compare to others phone in this price but clicks decent good quality pictures but was expecting more than this under 25k mobile when we see the Sony hardware it's not that quality level so it's request to OnePlus developers that to give software updates regarding camera optimization and also battery optimization and about gaming it's very good in casual gaming but heats up when we use more than 10 to 15 minutes and last thing is about buying mobile through emi my friends don't ever buy phone thru emi with credit card bcos banks are charging hidden charges of GST cgst and all other stuff and around 500 rs my money was taken through all that useless charges bcos I buyed the mobile through ICICI credit card mobile. So avoid emi if possible."

      "Likes:1) Build quality is premium with glass front and back.2) Processor & RAM are fast for the application.3) Screen is of good quality with dynamic refresh rate.4) Camera performance good. But low light photo on wide angle camera is average or below average.5) 80W charger bundled in the box, charges the phone very quickly.6) Alert slider very convenient.Dislikes:1) Quite a few pre-installed one plus apps. Not all are very useful.2) Battery life is very average for a phone with 5000mAh battery. Also noticed that idle drain of the battery is very high.",
      "I too observed battery draining issues like every user complained on the internet. But this is also now fixed after the software upgrade (look for update details that specifically mentions about battery improvement)",
      "Pretty awesome phone under 40k, Maybe the Oneplus 11r is even better, but the only differences between these are the curved display(the display is the same in both, but here it's flat, there it's curved), back design, and Processor. Mediatek Dimensity 9000 works fantastic for even hardcore games. The display is super smooth, super large, and crystal clear. The battery lasts a day, Overall no complaints on any point except for the back design being so bland.",
      "Moved from iphone 14 pro Max to this onePositivesLight weightGood displayVery fast charging (loved it )Does not heat much as I do hotspot 5g rocksolid)Back panel looks good and premiumOs smooth and buttery (too much iOS influence)Negatives1.Camera seems lacklustre did not find greatMaybe coming from iPhone2. Volume seems low when connected to car audio system via bluetooth don't know why3. Battery back is average/above average not great .Don't know much about gaming ..never tried or don't play",
      "Everything about this phone is good but I found one major and one minor issue.  Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast. Dimensity 9000 is performing incredibly superb. No complaints on performance side.Update:- They are not fixing the battery drain.",
      "Display is gorgeous.Camera goodAlert slider is useful.Battery satisfied I don't play much games.Fast charging is awesome.Oxygen OS is bloatware free. Feels light and intuitive.Overall satisfied.",
      "",
      "The OnePlus Nord 3 Global version is a 🤌! I might say, the phone has some flagship qualities. If software updates can fix, tweak and boost the drawbacks...it will enter the flagship level.Pros: Beautiful and bright display (outdoor viewing is magnificent vs OPPO Find X5), Blazing fast charging (the same as the OPPO Find X5 Pro), impressive chipset (same SoC as the OPPO Find N2 flip), TUV certification for memory, very capable main camera (same as Oneplus 11), official IP rating despite being 54 only, longer and on time software support updates (3 years OS & 4 years security), & not bloatware-filled (deletable).Improvement suggestions: Longer on-screen battery life & better power efficiency (optimise software), better selfie and Ultra wide camera results, IP rating is 54 but could be better, the adaptive dynamic frame rate could be improved to reflect the claimed 40Hz or even down to 1Hz, WiFi 6E, Dual Wifi acceleration, eSim support.Overall, I would highly recommend especially if you want a phone under 1000 USD that's arguably flagship material! 💚OnePlus Australia also includes a free clear case and charger. P.s. I came from OPPO Find X5"

      "It’s really cool smartphone under 25k I got from Amazon. Camera quality is stunning. Battery is quite good it runs around 2 days on a single charge. Storage is good as per my requirements. Fast processor that allows multitasking. Overall, it’s a value for money deal for me.",
      "Bought this phone for my wife and she's been using it for 3-4 days now. She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range.",
      "Nice choice of you are casually gaming and multitasking. It has got Android 14 which makes it better and also OnePlus software is perfect. No lag faced till now. Will update further.Just one thing that selfie camera of perfect but the main back camera is not as expected. It's not bad like it cannot be preferred but the quality of camera can be improved if night mode doesn't focuses to brighten the face much",
      "I got it for 21k (8+128)GB variant!It's really value for money if you got it for even 22k.Don't get me wrong, I know there are new phones coming with good specs and I also know of that oppofication like it's running on Color OS type with clean experience... But yeah as It's a phone from the promising brand that's why I bought it.If you wanna do hardcore gaming the go for another options but for casual day to day life and task it's good, also it can handle little bit of gaming as per my experience!And yeah Don't go for the Sony IMX sensor! It doesn't perform as the OnePlus 12 bcs chipset also matters in camera processing!I hope you got it!Thanks...",

      "Likes:1) Build quality is premium with glass front and back.2) Processor & RAM are fast for the application.3) Screen is of good quality with dynamic refresh rate.4) Camera performance good. But low light photo on wide angle camera is average or below average.5) 80W charger bundled in the box, charges the phone very quickly.6) Alert slider very convenient.Dislikes:1) Quite a few pre-installed one plus apps. Not all are very useful.2) Battery life is very average for a phone with 5000mAh battery. Also noticed that idle drain of the battery is very high.",
      "I too observed battery draining issues like every user complained on the internet. But this is also now fixed after the software upgrade (look for update details that specifically mentions about battery improvement)",
      "Pretty awesome phone under 40k, Maybe the Oneplus 11r is even better, but the only differences between these are the curved display(the display is the same in both, but here it's flat, there it's curved), back design, and Processor. Mediatek Dimensity 9000 works fantastic for even hardcore games. The display is super smooth, super large, and crystal clear. The battery lasts a day, Overall no complaints on any point except for the back design being so bland.",
      "Moved from iphone 14 pro Max to this onePositivesLight weightGood displayVery fast charging (loved it )Does not heat much as I do hotspot 5g rocksolid)Back panel looks good and premiumOs smooth and buttery (too much iOS influence)Negatives1.Camera seems lacklustre did not find greatMaybe coming from iPhone2. Volume seems low when connected to car audio system via bluetooth don't know why3. Battery back is average/above average not great .Don't know much about gaming ..never tried or don't play",
      "Everything about this phone is good but I found one major and one minor issue.  Major- battery drain. The battery drain on this phone is a bit higher than average and also battery backup for a 5000mah battery is poor. It doesn't feel like this phone have a 5000mah power house. Minor- The back of the phone feels little bit warm sometimes ( very lesser amount of time ).Camera of the phone is awesome. Sound output is also good. No issues in display. Extremely happy with such low bezels but finding a perfect tempered glass for such a low bezel screen is a pain.Over-all, it's a decent buy if you're looking for a phone under 40K without curved screen. Oxygen OS/Color os is very user friendly and have all the features an average human askes for. Fingerprint scanner is a bit on the lower side of the screen but absolutely fast. Dimensity 9000 is performing incredibly superb. No complaints on performance side.Update:- They are not fixing the battery drain.",
      "Display is gorgeous.Camera goodAlert slider is useful.Battery satisfied I don't play much games.Fast charging is awesome.Oxygen OS is bloatware free. Feels light and intuitive.Overall satisfied.",

      "The OnePlus Nord 3 Global version is a 🤌! I might say, the phone has some flagship qualities. If software updates can fix, tweak and boost the drawbacks...it will enter the flagship level.Pros: Beautiful and bright display (outdoor viewing is magnificent vs OPPO Find X5), Blazing fast charging (the same as the OPPO Find X5 Pro), impressive chipset (same SoC as the OPPO Find N2 flip), TUV certification for memory, very capable main camera (same as Oneplus 11), official IP rating despite being 54 only, longer and on time software support updates (3 years OS & 4 years security), & not bloatware-filled (deletable).Improvement suggestions: Longer on-screen battery life & better power efficiency (optimise software), better selfie and Ultra wide camera results, IP rating is 54 but could be better, the adaptive dynamic frame rate could be improved to reflect the claimed 40Hz or even down to 1Hz, WiFi 6E, Dual Wifi acceleration, eSim support.Overall, I would highly recommend especially if you want a phone under 1000 USD that's arguably flagship material! 💚OnePlus Australia also includes a free clear case and charger. P.s. I came from OPPO Find X5"
